Info:Leading ride-sharing company Ola wants to give everyone access to safe, reasonably priced transportation.

The turnover rate of Ola's drivers is a persistent problem. Reducing attrition and ensuring driver loyalty are essential to the business's operations.

Patterns in driver performance, happiness, and behavior can be found by analyzing driver data. This would facilitate the taking of preventative action by anticipating possible turnover.

The primary goal is to use a variety of factors to identify possible driver churn in order to preserve a steady driver base and guarantee business continuity.
